Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

The client was a company called DriverPass who was aiming to create resource to help students pass their driving exams. They wanted to design a system that provided its users with access to various types of learning material and content. The users would also be able to schedule in-person training and driving lessons with certified drivers. This system provided one location for all their learning content, training scheduling and testing results and progress.


What did you do particularly well? 

I believe that I addressed the concerns and requirements of the client well. I took the DriverPass transcript and ensured that every requirement and need from the client was taken into consideration during the design and development of the system architecture. I believe I also consider several use cases and processes that the various users might encounter with the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I would consider looking more into my the process administrators might take for updating the system content when the DMV issues updates or policy/requirement changes.  The approach I took was too high-level and did not consier all the possible steps required to do so.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I carefully read through the interview transcript several times and took notes.  This helped me identify important aspects of the clients needs and requirements and referred back to my notes throughout the design and development phases.  The functionality requirements communicated by the client was one of the most important aspects of this project - the system had to do what they wanted.  Additionally, I always kept the reason in mind as well, "Why they wanted the system and what they hoped it would do".  This helped me keep the users/students in mind and ensure that the functionality and design aspects of the project created an environment that helped them reach their goals of passing their tests and making it an enjoyable process.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

When developing software, it's important to understand the clients needs, desires, goals and the limitations of such.  Consistently checking in with them and verifying and consulting the progress ensures that you're still on track and that you've interpreted their needs accurately.  It's a lengthy process, but it must be taken with care and precision.
