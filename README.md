Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room and their software requirements included a game application, Draw It or Lose IT, that they wanted to distribute amongst the various operating systems to expand their availability to all kinds of players who use all the platforms.  The game involved teams that competed to guess the image being drawn.  The game requirements included storing all game-used images, gameplay round and timer functionality and maintaing memory of teams, users and gameplay details.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The applications documentation outlined the details of the design and development of the application in such a way that other teams could repeat the process, if they needed to perform the same actions for a new game in the future.  This would greatly increase the efficiency in application development and deployment.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document helped me understand what steps I was taking next, based upon the previously completed steps.  It outlined how the actions played into the requirements of the next development phase.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Logging and tracking issues throughout the development process would be helpful to not only myself, but others, when developing other applications in the future, because it would streamline the process of identifying potential issues and the mitigation efforts required to resolve them in a timely manner.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Keeping the user in mind during the design and development of the application was crucial to its success because the user is the final evaluator of the application and its ability to deliver the service it promises.  Understanding what they need and how they will interact with the application provides me, the developer, with the necessary guidelines that help me focus on the most important features and capabilities of the application.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Gathering requirements, analyzing the current state of the application/system, documenting the transition efforts required and migrating current functionality with new functionality all help the design and development phases of the project and can be repeated for similar applications in the future.
