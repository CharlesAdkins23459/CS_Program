Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The Corner Grocer needed a program that analyzed the text records they generated throughout the day, which lists items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opened to the time it closed.  This program would be used to help them arrange the produce section based upon how often items are purchased, which will assist their customers by having those items in stock on a more regular basis and in a more accessible fashion.

What did you do particularly well?

The organization of the code is laid out in a manner that is easy for other users/contributors can understand its functionality and make any future changes that the business may request or need.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The code could be enhance to ensure that it is accurate for every use-case and edge-case that it may encounter based upon the purchase behaviors across time.  If the program is ineffective across time, it can’t help the business improve adequately. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Utilizing both C++ and Python was difficult as their format and syntax are drastically different.  Utilizing the help of my peers, outside resources and tutoring streamlined the process and helped me develop a decently polished deliverable.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Understanding the basics of combining two languages will be incredibly helpful in the future, should I ever need to build a complex program again, as I most certainly will.  The flexibility of that skill will help me bridge the gaps where one language may not have an easy way to approach a specific business/program requirement.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The comments will help contributors understand what each section does and the logic contained within each step of the program. Should they need to make edits, they’ll be able to easily understand where to update the code.
